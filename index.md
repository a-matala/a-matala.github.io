# Austin Matala
**Aerospace Engineering Student**  
CAD • Inspection • Design

Welcome to my engineering portfolio. This site highlights my work in aerospace systems, modeling, and engineering design.

## Overview

I began my engineering path by graduating high school through Butler Tech’s Mechatronics program while concurrently earning an Associate of Science in Electro-Mechanical Engineering Technology. This foundation in electrical, mechanical, and manufacturing systems led me to pursue Aerospace Engineering at the University of Cincinnati, where I now focus on design, simulation, and systems-level problem solving. I am also concurrently pursuing a minor in Mathematics alongside my Bachelor of Science in Aerospace Engineering.

Along the way, I have completed engineering co-op and internship rotations at **Torfan Aerospace**, **Faxon Machining**, and **PoleZero**, working in environments that emphasize precision manufacturing, dimensional inspection, engineering documentation, and aerospace quality systems. These experiences have allowed me to connect classroom theory with real-world design, inspection, and compliance workflows.

Looking ahead, I am continuing to deepen my technical focus in **aerodynamics**, **control systems**, and **aerospace design**, with the goal of contributing to high-reliability engineering systems in the aerospace and advanced manufacturing sectors.
